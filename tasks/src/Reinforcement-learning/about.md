## Use Cases

### Robotics

Reinforcement learning is used in robotics to enable robots to learn from experience and improve their performance over time. For example, a robot might have the goal to clean a floor by starting in one corner and moving in a straight line until it reaches the other corner. If the robot encounters an obstacle, it will learn from this experience and try a different route the next time it cleans the floor.

### Gaming

Reinforcement learning is used in video games to provide non-playable characters with a set of possible actions. The trained model then rewards them for selecting the optimal action. This allows non-playable characters to learn from their mistakes and eventually become better at choosing the optimal actions.
