## Use Cases

### Gaming

Reinforcement learning is used in video games to provide non-playable characters with a set of possible actions. The trained model then rewards them for selecting the optimal action. This allows non-playable characters to learn from their mistakes and eventually become better at choosing the optimal actions.
